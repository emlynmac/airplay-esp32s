/**
 * @file sendspin.h
 * @brief Sendspin player-role client (experimental, first milestone).
 *
 * Sendspin is a multi-room audio protocol in which the *server* discovers and
 * connects to speakers.  A speaker advertises _sendspin._tcp with the
 * WebSocket path to use, the server opens that socket, and the two exchange
 * JSON control messages plus binary audio chunks timestamped in the server's
 * monotonic clock.
 *
 * This build implements enough of it to prove the timing path:
 *
 *   - the WebSocket endpoint and its framing, including reassembly;
 *   - the Noise KKpsk2 handshake keyed with the published Sentinel PSK, and
 *     the encrypted transport that follows it;
 *   - the init/hello/activate handshake, the client/time clock exchange and
 *     client/state reporting;
 *   - PCM stream playout through audio_engine_v2.
 *
 * It does NOT implement pairing or the FLAC and Opus codecs.  Keying with the
 * Sentinel leaves the session *unpaired*: encrypted and replay-protected, but
 * with neither peer's identity proven, so a server may only use it for
 * playback once its operator has approved the device.
 *
 * Only one audio source can drive the output at a time.  Sendspin announces
 * itself unavailable while AirPlay, Bluetooth or USB owns it, which is the
 * protocol's own answer to an external source taking the speaker.

 *
 * There are only four slots and a fifth pairing evicts the oldest, so this is
 * how an operator clears out servers that are no longer around.
 *
 * Forgetting one side of a pairing strands the other: the server goes on
 * offering a PSK this device can no longer resolve, and the handshake then

 * way out of that deadlock without editing the server's own store.
 *
 * The pairing token changes with the identity; the PIN does not.  The server
 * is left holding an orphan record for the old identity.
