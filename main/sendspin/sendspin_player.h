/**
 * @file sendspin_player.h
 * @brief Sendspin "player@v1" playout, built on the AirPlay engine.
 *
 * Sendspin and AirPlay pose the same problem — PCM addressed by a timestamp
 * in a remote clock's domain, to be emitted exactly on time by a local
 * crystal that does not agree — so this reuses audio_engine_v2 wholesale
 * rather than growing a second scheduler.  What it adds is the translation:
 *
 *   - chunk timestamps (server microseconds) become RTP sample numbers
 *     relative to the first chunk of the stream, which is what the clock map
 *     and scheduler consume;
 *   - variable-length chunks (the protocol allows 15-150 ms) are re-cut into
 *     the timeline's fixed blocks, which must land on the block phase;
 *   - the local playout instant is converted into the server's domain with
 *     sendspin_time before the scheduler is asked for samples.
 *
 * The engine here is a second, smaller instance rather than the receiver's:
 * the receiver's is never torn down (the playback task renders from it), and
 * hijacking it would mean reasoning about a handover while both stacks are
 * live.  Ownership of the I2S output is arbitrated one level up.
