/**
 * @file sendspin_psk.h
 * @brief The pre-shared keys a Sendspin handshake can be keyed with.
 *
 * Every connection is a `KKpsk2` handshake, and which PSK goes into it is
 * what decides whether the session is authenticated.  The server names its
 * choice by `psk_id` in the message 1 payload and the client answers with the
 * matching key, so the client's job is to hold a set of candidates and look
 * one up:
 *
 *   - the **Sentinel**, a constant published in the specification.  A session
 *     keyed with it is *unpaired*: encrypted and replay-protected, but with
 *     neither peer's identity proven.
 *   - the **pairing PSK**, drawn from the CSPRNG once per device and never
 *     rotated by the client itself.  It authenticates the one handshake in
 *     which the device is adopted, and is handed to the operator out of band
 *     as a pairing token.
 *   - a **long-term PSK** per paired server, delivered by the client at the
 *     end of that pairing and used for every session with it afterwards.
 *
 * The pairing PSK is long-lived and pairs the device with any number of
 * servers, so it is a standing credential: anyone holding the token can adopt
 * the device.  Long-term PSKs are per-server and are what actually
 * authenticate day-to-day sessions.
