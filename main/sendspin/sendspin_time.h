/**
 * @file sendspin_time.h
 * @brief Sendspin client/server clock estimator.
 *
 * Sendspin timestamps every audio chunk with the instant, on the *server's*
 * monotonic microsecond clock, at which the first sample must leave the
 * speaker.  Nothing in the protocol relates that clock to ours, so the client
 * has to estimate the mapping itself from client/time exchanges:
 *
 *     client -> server  { client_transmitted }
 *     server -> client  { client_transmitted, server_received,
 *                         server_transmitted }
 *
 * plus the local arrival time, giving the four timestamps of an NTP-style
 * round trip.  Each exchange yields one offset estimate; a least-squares fit
 * over a sliding window of the low-latency ones recovers both the offset and
 * the *rate* difference between the two crystals, which is what stops the
 * playout position walking away over a long track.
 *
 * This is the AirPlay ntp_clock.c problem with different field names, and the
 * output is consumed the same way: audio_engine_v2 works in the sender's
 * clock domain, so the renderer converts its local playout instant with
 * sendspin_time_offset_ns() before asking the scheduler what to emit.
